# How to Use TORA Software for Operations Research Problems
 
Operations research (OR) is a discipline that applies mathematical and analytical techniques to solve complex decision-making problems. OR can help optimize various aspects of business, engineering, management, and science, such as scheduling, inventory, logistics, transportation, network design, and more.

One of the tools that can assist OR practitioners and students is TORA software. TORA stands for **TOol for opeRations research Applications**. It is a free software that can solve various types of OR problems, such as linear programming, integer programming, nonlinear programming, network analysis, game theory, simulation, and queuing theory.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use TORA software for some common OR problems. We will also provide you with a link to download TORA software for free. If you are interested in learning more about OR and TORA software, read on!
  
## How to Download TORA Software for Free
 
Before you can use TORA software, you need to download it and install it on your computer. TORA software is compatible with Windows operating systems. You can download TORA software for free from the following link:
 
[https://www.tora.com/download](https://www.tora.com/download)
 
Once you have downloaded the file, you need to unzip it and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
 
After you have installed TORA software, you can launch it from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a window like this:
 
![TORA window](https://www.tora.com/images/tora-window.png)
 
This is the main window of TORA software. Here you can select the type of problem you want to solve from the drop-down menu on the top left corner. You can also access the help menu, the options menu, and the exit button from the top right corner.
  
## How to Use TORA Software for Linear Programming Problems
 
Linear programming (LP) is one of the most widely used techniques in OR. It involves finding the optimal values of some variables that satisfy a set of linear constraints and maximize or minimize a linear objective function.
 
To use TORA software for LP problems, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Select "Linear Programming" from the drop-down menu on the top left corner of the main window.
2. Enter the number of decision variables and constraints in the boxes below the menu.
3. Click on "OK". You will see a table like this:

![TORA LP table](https://www.tora.com/images/tora-lp-table.png)

1. Enter the coefficients of the objective function and the constraints in the table. You can also enter the names of the variables and constraints in the first row and column.
2. Select whether you want to maximize or minimize the objective function from the radio buttons below the table.
3. Select whether each constraint is an equality or an inequality from the drop-down menus on the right side of the table.
4. Select whether each variable is nonnegative or unrestricted from the drop-down menus on the bottom of the table.
5. Click on "Solve". You will see a window like this:

1. This window shows you the optimal solution of the LP problem. You can see the optimal values of the variables and the objective function, as well as the slack or surplus values of the constraints.
2. You can also see a graphical representation of the feasible region and the optimal solution by clicking on "Graph" on the bottom left corner of the window.
3. You can also see a detailed report of the solution process by clicking on "Report" on the bottom right corner of the window.

## How to Use TORA Software for Other Types of OR Problems
 
TORA software can also solve other types of OR problems besides LP. For example, you can use TORA software for
